# 🗳️ Voting DApp

A decentralized voting application built using **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **Ethers.js**, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. This project allows users to vote for candidates on the blockchain through a simple web interface connected to MetaMask.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a basic decentralized application (DApp) that demonstrates how to:
- Connect a website to MetaMask using Ethers.js
- Deploy a smart contract to a test network (like Sepolia)
- Interact with the smart contract to **cast votes** and **view results**

The DApp supports three candidates:
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Charlie**

Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, and users can see the total votes in real-time.
